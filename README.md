# Object Detection using DeepSORT, YOLOv8 and OpenCV
This is a simple project which aims to detect objects appearing in a camera/video/images using YOLOv8 and OpenCV.


##Requirements

```

Numpy
Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
tracker.py
detections (Folder)
networks (Folder)
deep_sort (Folder)
Tensorflow


```

#How?
First you need to install and download the requiements bellow. Then, you need to specify you video/image path (or camera) [input and output] in the ObjectDetection file in the second cell.

In the same folder, you need to download used data and the pre-trained model from this [Drive Link]([https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18fKzfqnqhqW3s9zwsCbnVJ5XF2JFeqMp]). You have to extract those folders in the main one or change path in tracker.py.

And you good to go.![Results](https://github.com/AnisRajhi/Object-Detection---DeepSORT-YOLOv8/assets/91371117/6cdafc8b-b966-4cec-ba0d-20e7e1fe06d2)
